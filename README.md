# Description of the project
An activitytracker, offers the user the possibility to save his sports activities like in a smartwatch.
I implmented the most common ones, running and Cycling. Others are also possible. As an addon to the usual tracker,
there is a second service, which tracks the condition of the equipment and offers the user reminderer to refresh the equipment.
